Write a simple Python module that contains one function that prints 'hello' 
(module name = my_func.py). Do a test where you import my_func into a new 
Python script. Test this using the following contexts:
        * my_func.py is located in the same directory as your script
        * my_func.py is located in some random subdirectory (not the same directory as your script)
        * my_func.py is located in ~/applied_python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

def print_hello():
    print 'Hello'
def main():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
