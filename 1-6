# Write a Python program that creates a list. One of the elements of the 
# list should be a dictionary with at least two keys. Write this list out to 
# a file using both YAML and JSON formats. The YAML file should be in the 
# expanded form.

import yaml
import json

newlist = [1, 2, 3, 'Cisco', 12.2, {'January': 1}, {'February': 2}]

with open("ymallist.yml", 'w') as y:
    y.write(yaml.dump(newlist, default_flow_style=False))

with open("jsonlist.json", 'w') as j:
    json.dump(newlist, j)
